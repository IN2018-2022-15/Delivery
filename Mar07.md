## Description

<p> Quick Fit Fitters plc currently operates without a comprehensive IT system which puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to their competition. To resolve this a specialised IT system (GARTIS) will be developed and tested to help optimise as well as improve the service the Ashford branch of Quick Fit Fitters currently provides. The purpose of this document is to detail the design, development, and the testing of the GARTIS system.<p>
<br>
<p> Within the old system customers can book their vehicles for a service MoT or repair via email or telephone, this is handled by reception. Allocated repair or MoT slots are recorded on a marker board between the reception and the repair shop. After booking a check is made of the customer card to see if they have any outstanding payments. If no money is owed, a job sheet will be developed detailing the problem to be resolved and given to the repair shop. For account customers, reception can dispatch a mechanic to collect the vehicle otherwise a customer must deliver their vehicle for service themselves.  Customers can also decide to request a service without any prior booking, in this case their vehicle will wait in the yard until a repair bay becomes available. The customer is then told a price estimate for the service they require and asked whether they wish to proceed with the service. Account holders may have a discount plan and can choose to pay with credit allowing them to pay for the service at a later date. Non-account customers will receive an invoice once they collect their vehicle which details the jobs done and the price for which they must pay immediately. Parts which are needed for a job are taken from within the store, if a part is not present then an order to another garage or manufacturer will be placed. These orders are emailed and then collected by an allocated driver. If an issue obtaining a required part occurs the customer will be contacted, and their vehicle will stay in the yard until it can be repaired.<p>

### Indexed List

| Use case name | Level |	Justification |
|----|----|----|
|Set Customer Discount Plan|High|Having customer discount plan is needed and essential for the business to develop its product awareness and their business|
|Alter Customer Discount Plan|Low|Not so important altering the discount plan as when you state discount you don`t often change it|
|Alter customer account	|High|	Altering the customer account can be important if a change has been made to its previous account details|
|Search customer	|Moderate|	Searching a customer isn`t so important but still something that that needs to be done as you need to search for the customer to change the discount plan|
|Configure pay late	|Moderate|	Medium because it is not an often thing for customer to pay late|
|Acknowledge late payment alert	|H|	Important as if the franchisee doesn`t acknowledge this then non one will do anything or will know anything about the late payment|
|Configure automatic report	|Moderate|	Configuring the report is not so very important but it is still something they should do|
|Configure stock alert threshold	|High|	Quite important knowing how the stock levels are, as you never want to run out of stock|
|Alter job	|Moderate|	Not so important as not many people will check on the status of the job except the mechanic, but it is good to have, as the customer may want to know when they may get their vehicle back|
|View job	|Low|	Viewing the job isn\`t going to be done so much, apart from the mechanic, so this isn`t so important|
|Search stock	|Moderate|	Searching for stock can be important, as you need to search to see if there are any more parts still in stock, to see if you need to stock up|
|View report	|Moderate|	Viewing report can also be important, because it is good to check on the reports either printed for the stock or the booking summary|
|Print report	|Moderate|	Printing reports is something that is needed, because you can still have a digital copy, and it does take longer to print out each report, and cost more|
|Create booking summary report	|High|	Making a booking summary is important, because it is good to have previous booking records, to work of and keep contact of, just in case it may come in handy|
|Late payment alert	|High|	This is very important, as it keeps the business up to date with its inflow, and prevents loss of money, and wasted time |
|Generate stock report|High|	Creating a stock report is vital, always want to be on top of what stock we have and what is needed|
|Order parts |High|	Ordering parts is high, because without this you cannot complete vehicles. Without parts vehicles cannot be completed|

|Send MOT reminder	|Moderate|	Sending mot reminders is something needed but not so important|
|View invoice	|High|	Viewing the invoice is important because it will be viewed by the customer |
|Add job	|High|	Adding a job is important because the mechanic needs to know when he has new jobs and how many jobs, he has to complete|
|Search job	|Moderate|	Searching a job can be quite important as all jobs will be in a list and to select any job ongoing, you will have to search for it.|
|Check progress	|Moderate|	Progress is not vital but a good thing to have updated, as it gives an estimate, of how far a vehicle is too being completed|
|Create customer record	|Moderate|	Making a customer record isn`t that important but good to keep in their contact details and addresses, it saves time not having to manually create a new customer account again and again|
|Create invoice	|High|	Creating invoice is important gives all the details and reports to the customer about their purchase|
|Create account	|High|	Creating accounts is quite important, as each account needs to have their own access to important data, and if there are no accounts, then there isn`t any security, so anyone can check valuable information|
|Delete account	|Moderate|	Deleting accounts isn\`t as important as creating but still it\`s good to be able to make space, and get rid of unnecessary accounts|
|Edit account	|High|	Important to be able to edit account because mistakes can be made and will need correcting, and if accounts are not altered, this can waste a lot of time and efficiency|
|Backup database	|High|	Backing up database is important, to have all the info and details incise of something bad happens and you lose it all|
|Restore database	|High|	Admin will need to restore the database when needed, so it is important|
|Configure Stock Report	|High|	This is vital, as the business needs to always be on top of the stock, so changing the stock is an important process to the system, as it can have a large impact on many other things.|
|Configure Booking Summary Report	|Moderate|	Changing the booking summary can be vital, because sometimes mistakes can be made, and a report will need to be altered.|
|Configure Price Timer Report	|Moderate|	This is important because, you give an estimate to the customer, so they know when they can expect the car.|
|Generate Booking Summary Report	|Low|	Generating a booking summary report isn\`t so important, but is a good thing to have, it isn`t very useful for the user|
|Generate Price Time Summary Report	|Moderate|	This is important as it tells us the expected time of the vehicle to be completed|
|Generate Stock Report	|Moderate|	Creating a stock report is vital, as it is free, digital and important to have, so the business know if they are out of stock or not|
|Send Annual Service Reminder	|High|	This is very important, because customers getting their car service is a necessity, for customers.|
|Send Mot Reminder	|Moderate|	Sending MOT reminder is vital, as the customer need to be reminded that they need to bring their vehicle for a check up to check if its legal on the roads.|
|View Booking Summary Reports	|Moderate|	Having a booking summary report again isn\`t vital, it's a good thing to have, to keep on track with all the bookings made but not a necessity.|
|View Stock Report	|Moderate|	Viewing the stock report isn`t important to where the business cannot run, however it is still a good thing to check and see constantly to keep up on the stock, and see the pattern of what is being used the most etc.|
|Log in 	|High|	Logging in is so important as the business needs to have areas where only a few people can access, such as customer records. These cannot be accessible to everyone because that would be illegal.|
|Log out	|High|	Same with logging in, this is vital, because it protects the confidentiality of the account, and everything it can access.|
|Send reminder	|High|	Sending reminders is important, because cars need to be road worthy, and if it does not pass the MOT test that is a safety risk, for the driver, and other drivers and it should not be allowed on the roads. So, you will be putting people`s lives at risk, if this does not happened.|
